Here the task to Predict Salary for different Job Types. Some the the features included in the dataset are:
* Job Type: Designation of the Job.
* Degree: What degree does the person have.
* Major: Type of Major.
* Industry: Type of Industry
* YearsExperience: Years of Experience working
* Miles From Metropolis: How far is the job from City

## Cleaning and Preprocessing
Initially, I checked for any duplicate values in the data. After which I checked for the Null values. Data was pretty much clean. Next, I checked for different categorical and numerical features and performed analysis on all those different features to check for outliers and ambiguity.

## Exploratory Data Analysis
Performed EDA to get more insight into the data, check for correlation and engineer features in order for the model to perform better.

## Summary
Successfully completed the analysis and training for Salary Prediction problem for different job type. Performed Exploratory Data Analysis to get insights from the data and then preprocessed the data accordingly inorder to fit a model. Established a **Baseline Linear regression** model and observed MSE of **383**. Improved the Baseline score by chossing different models and doing cross Validation and achieved the **Final MSE of 355 using XGBoost** Model. Automated the complete pipeline and saved the predictions onto the disk.
